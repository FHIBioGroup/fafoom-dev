Local optimization will be performed with INTERFACE ForceField.
Setting a default value for constrained_geometry_file: adds/geometry.in.constrained
Setting a default value for fix_centroid: None
Setting a default value for right_order_to_assign: ['torsion', 'cistrans', 'centroid', 'orientation']
Number of identified centroid: 1
Identified centroid: [(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28)]
Will generate 100 structures


The geometry of Structure 1 is valid, copied to /valid


The geometry of Structure 2 is valid, copied to /valid


The geometry of Structure 3 is valid, copied to /valid


The geometry of Structure 4 is valid, copied to /valid
